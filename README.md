<h1>RU58841 vs GW0742: My Real Experience Using Both</h1>

<p>RU58841 and GW0742 are nothing alikeâ€”but people confuse them all the time. One is a topical anti-androgen used for hair loss. The other is a metabolic modulator that boosts endurance and burns fat. Iâ€™ve used both for months and hereâ€™s the no-BS breakdown.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Compared These</h2>
<p>I used <strong>RU58841</strong> daily on my scalp for 6 months. At the same time, I ran an 8-week cut cycle with <strong>GW0742</strong>. I used both from Chemyo:</p>

<h2>What Is RU58841?</h2>
<p><strong>RU58841</strong> is a topical anti-androgen. It blocks DHT at the hair follicle without messing with your hormones systemically. That means no major suppression or side effects if used right. Itâ€™s mostly used to stop male pattern baldness.</p>

<h3>My RU58841 Results</h3>
<p>I applied 50mg daily to the crown and temples using a dropper. After 6 months, I saw a real differenceâ€”especially in shedding. It didnâ€™t regrow hair like magic, but it stopped hair loss completely and thickened what was left.</p>
<p>No acne. No libido drop. No mood changes. Way better than finasteride for me.</p>

<h3>RU58841 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stops hair loss fast</li>
  <li>No systemic side effects</li>
  <li>Can thicken existing hair</li>
  <li>Works well with minoxidil</li>
</ul>

<h3>RU58841 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Needs daily application</li>
  <li>Results take months (be patient)</li>
  <li>Not FDA approved (research only)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Hair loss prevention, DHT sensitivity, anti-androgen use without systemic suppression</h4>

<h2>What Is GW0742?</h2>
<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a PPARÎ´ receptor agonistâ€”similar to Cardarine (GW501516) but stronger and newer. Itâ€™s known for endurance, fat loss, and increasing metabolic output. This is not a SARM. It's a PPAR modulator.</p>

<h3>My GW0742 Results</h3>
<p>I took 10mg/day for 8 weeks during a cut. Energy in the gym was next level. I dropped 9 pounds while keeping muscle. My resting heart rate dropped tooâ€”felt like my cardio conditioning improved fast.</p>
<p>It also helped with recovery. I trained 6 days/week without burnout. No suppression. No crash after.</p>

<h3>GW0742 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Burns fat while preserving muscle</li>
  <li>Boosts endurance and stamina</li>
  <li>Zero suppression or liver stress</li>
  <li>Improves cardio performance noticeably</li>
</ul>

<h3>GW0742 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not for bulking (no anabolic effects)</li>
  <li>Can lower appetite (a plus or minus)</li>
  <li>Still in research phase (not FDA-approved)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, recomposition, endurance training, cardio boost</h4>
